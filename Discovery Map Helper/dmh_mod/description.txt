Helps get the [orange]Pathfinder[normal] achievement.

This mod repaint colors the road map, and also removes all the icons, road numbers and company logos.

[orange]Notes:[normal]

Company logos will be disabled in the job list, too. Because the game uses the same sprites as to draw on the map.

If the modification is not applied (colors of road map unchanged) or applied partially - You can try to increase the priority of the modification.
