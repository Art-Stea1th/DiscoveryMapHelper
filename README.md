# Discovery Map Helper

Game Mod for the **Euro Truck Simulator 2.** Helps get the **Pathfinder** achievement.
*Repaint colors on the road map, and also removes all the icons, road numbers and company logos.*

> Ready for the "DLC France", "Scandinavia DLC" and the "Going East! DLC".[/h1]
* This mod does not affect the map, it only changes the map view.
* It should work fine with 99% of existing Euro Truck Simulator 2 modifications.
* It should work fine even with those mods that expand the map, add new cities and roads.
* Even if any of the mods you've added will change colors or a legend on the map, this mod will be able to cope with this, you should **just increase the priority of this mod**.

> However
* If any of the mods you installed adds new icons/emblems to the map view, instead of changing existing ones, then this mod can not hide them regardless of its priority.
